# Overview 

* We have develop a hiring platform and employee bonus app. This platform helps the company place all employee data in the companies blockchain & pays them bonuses based off their driving performance over the course of their employment. Paying employees bonuses based off driving performance using crypto is going to be an industry first. Bonuses are paid to employee wallets in Ethereum. 

* Candidate need to share is the Driving record, Trucking insurance resume, references to be uploaded to the companies blockchain. 

* We also wanted to give truckers the opportunity to share & upload their data to the company blockchain for transparency. 

* The company uses private\public Ethereum blockchain


# Looking Forward to the Future
* This will help trucking companies to change the parameters of their driving scoring system. Our company would also like to implement Electronic Logging Devices and Cameras to the system. This way once the driver is hired the Trucking company can keep a closer eye.
