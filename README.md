* The Trucking industry is experience an extreme shortage of drivers. This has led to several larger problems including hiring inexperienced drivers. We would like to develop a hiring platform and employee bonus software. This platform not only helps trucking companies hire great candidates but it also helps pay them bonuses based off their drivin performance over the course of their employment.  
Some of the data that we want the job candidate to be able to share is the Driving record, Trucking insurance resume, references. 
This innovation will attract better candidates. Paying truckers bonuses based off driving performance using crypto is going to be an industry first.
We also wanted to give truckers the opportunity to share their data with whomever them seem to be fit. This also gives truckers the ability to find better paying jobs and be more competitive in the marketplace. In a sense we are not only a resume which will house a candidates resume, but we are also creating a platform where the trucker can receive their compensation. 

* What happens if a driver has the potential to be a great employee but is not technology friendly and doesn't want to use this wallet? Can the use of this technology cause more harm to the industry then help it? 
We are interested in creating our own blockchain for this. Even though we are using the Ethereum blockchain now and it is functional we feel like there is too much sensitive information we wouldn't want on a public chain. 
Creating a UI for Trucking companies to change the parameters of their scoring system. We would also like to implement Electronic Logging Devices and Cameras to the system. This way once the driver is hired the Trucking company can keep a closer eye on the data.
